# Logistic-Regression
A term project on the manual implementation of logistic regression using JAX library

Traditionally, predicting the labels of images is done using deep learning and CNNs (convolutional neural networks) as the non-linearity of these models allow them to extract high level features of the images and produce predictions with high accuracy. This project explores the performance of linear models on classification tasks, and how different data preprocessing functions can help to improve such models.
